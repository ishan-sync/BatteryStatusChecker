This project is a small project of mine. It basically give a solution to problem I faced recently.

Let me explain in detail.

In current days in Sri Lanka there are ongoing power cuts due to economic crisis. So, I built a battery bank
as a solution for it. But I had issue with identify the current battery charging status according to battery 
voltage. So I did some studies and found how to calculate. Be honest I am a lazy guy so I did not wanted to do
those calculations manually over and over again. So as a result I built this simple web app to make that process easier.
